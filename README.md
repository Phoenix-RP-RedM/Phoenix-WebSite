Make sure these are started before all others plugins !

# Installation
Simply clone the `Phoenix--[NAME_MODULE_HERE]` into your `resources/[ Phoenix ]` folder, and start it via `ensure Phoenix--[NAME_MODULE_HERE]` in your `resources.cfg` config file.

If you use our database you can activate it in list of activatedModules on the collection `params` _if its missing, add it in the list_.
If you do not use our database go to the `[ Configs ]/[ Core ]/Modules.lua` file in `Phoenix-Core` set it to `true` in the list `PhoenixSettings.activatedModules` _if its missing, add it in the list_.
